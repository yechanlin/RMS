## Project Overview

This project creates an interactive graph-based interface where users can:
1. Upload a base CV/Resume
2. Add company nodes for target companies
3. Create job-specific nodes with titles and descriptions
4. Generate tailored resumes using AI based on the company and role

### Motivation: the problem with resume builder

Traditional resume builders are unnecessarily complicated, forcing users through complex multi-step wizards, overwhelming template selections, and rigid formatting constraints when all they want is something simple and effective. Most existing solutions focus on creating resumes from scratch rather than helping users manage and optimize what they already have. Our Resume Management System takes a different approach - it's designed as a **management system first**, where users can easily organize their base CV and systematically tailor it for specific roles and companies. The core philosophy is simplicity: upload your CV once, organize your target companies and roles visually, and let AI handle the intelligent tailoring. Rather than rebuilding your resume every time, you manage one master document and generate focused variations as needed. This approach reduces complexity while maximizing efficiency, allowing job seekers to focus on what matters most - landing the right role with a perfectly tailored resume.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** - UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **React Flow** - Graph visualization
- **React Router** - Navigation
- **Axios** - HTTP client

### Backend
- **Django** - Web framework
- **Django REST Framework** - API development
- **SQLite** - Database (prototype) / PostgreSQL (production ready)
- **PyPDF2/pdfplumber** - PDF processing
- **OpenAI/Anthropic** - AI resume generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- No database setup required (SQLite included)

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ResumeBuilder

# Start both servers with one command
./start_servers.sh
```

This will automatically:
- Start the Django backend on `http://localhost:8000`
- Start the React frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- Run database migrations
- Install dependencies if needed

### Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver 8000
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**Note:** Backend runs on port 8000, frontend on port 3000.

## Team Structure
